Smart Anomaly Detection System for Elderly Safety Using LSTM and Environmental Sensors

With the growing number of elderly people choosing to live independently, there's a critical need for reliable and privacy-friendly monitoring solutions. Existing tools like wearables and CCTV fall short due to their intrusiveness or reliance on consistent user interaction. Our goal was to create a smarter alternative that works passively and respects personal space.

We built a complete end-to-end monitoring solution that uses environmental sensors—light, sound, and mmWave movement detectors to passively track behavioral patterns. An LSTM Autoencoder model was trained to recognize normal daily routines and detect deviations in real-time. The system was deployed for a full month in a real home environment, collecting continuous data and analyzing behavior for signs of emergencies or irregularities.

Our outcomes include:
- Successful deployment of the system in a live smart home setting for over 30 days.
- Detection of anomalies in daily routines (e.g., unusual inactivity, sudden movement changes) with high accuracy and minimal false alarms.
- A privacy-conscious and non-intrusive solution—no cameras or wearables involved.
- Demonstration of the system’s scalability and generalizability to different living environments.

This project is a significant step toward ethical, intelligent elderly care, empowering seniors to live safely and independently while giving peace of mind to families and caregivers.
